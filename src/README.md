The process behind how I made these examples (particularly example 0):

- handwrite the html output
- define the corresponding data structures in typescript
- write the render function that produces output like the handwritten version
- add interactive controls and call the render function whenever a control is clicked/dragged
- write a parsing function so that I can modify the example's starting state to my liking using the interactive controls instead of using raw html/typescript
- refactor some of the messy bits
